# ActiveStereoNet (Project will be switched to 'tf2.0' branch. Not finished.) 
Based on the paper: ActiveStereoNet: End-to-End Self-Supervised Learning for Active Stereo Systems.

The code is just about part of network architecture, so please only regard it as reference.

Future Workï¼šInvalidation network is similar to StereoNet, maybe I will implement that in the future.
